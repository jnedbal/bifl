bifl is a compilation of Matlab scripts for burst integrated fluorescence lifetime analysis.
Start it by typing:

 biflgui

on the Matlab command line.

Bifl imports FIFO data from Becker&Hickl SPC830 time-correlated single photon counting card. It segments the data into burst of fluorescence photons emerging from single cells and produces series of histograms of burst parameters. It also gives an ICS file with micro time histograms for analysis in TRI2.
